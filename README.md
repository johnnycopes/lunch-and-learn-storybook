#### What?

The purpose of this lesson is get you introduce you to [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), show you why it's useful, and provide a sandbox app where you can write your first stories for a component! We're going to cover:

- What is Storybook and what can it do?
- Demo of [Globetrotter app](https://globetrotter.surge.sh/) and corresponding [Storybook app](https://globetrotter-components.surge.sh/)
- Cool! How do we plan to use this at Insiten?
- Writing your first stories for a component
- Implementing the Actions addon to log component emissions
- Implementing the Knobs addon to dynamically adjust component properties
